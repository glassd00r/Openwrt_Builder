# Custom packet-steering for AN7581: threaded NAPI off + RPS=e on airoha_eth.
# Invoked by /etc/init.d/packet_steering on boot + every network reload.
# Without this override, upstream packet-steering.uc would write rps_cpus=1
# (CPU0 only). With threaded NAPI off + RPS=e, RX work spreads across CPUs 1-3
# and bursty UDP RX loss drops dramatically (24% -> 5%, +25% throughput).
